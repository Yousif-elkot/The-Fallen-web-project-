## 📖 Overview

**THE FALLEN** is a fully responsive, dark-fantasy themed landing page designed for an immersive RPG game. This project showcases modern web design techniques, focusing on atmospheric visuals, typography, and responsive layouts that adapt seamlessly from large desktop screens to mobile devices.

The design combines a "Dark Fantasy" aesthetic with modern gaming UI elements, utilizing deep reds (`#b30000`) and dark backgrounds (`#1a0000`) to set the mood.
